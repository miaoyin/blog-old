在vmware中安装fedora21，然后安装VMware Tools，执行命令之后，一路回车，结果在下面不断循环
{% highlight bash %}
The path "/bin/gcc" appears to be a valid path to the gcc binary.
Would you like to change it? [no] 
Searching for a valid kernel header path...
The path "" is not a valid path to the 3.19.7-200.fc21.x86_64 kernel headers.
Would you like to change it? [yes] 
{% endhighlight %}

猜测是缺少了dev包，执行下面命令后，就好了
{% highlight bash %}
sudo yum install kernel-devel
{% endhighlight %}
